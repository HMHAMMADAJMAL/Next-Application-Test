  "desc":"Sebae anemone The sebae anemone (Heteractis crispa) is a species of sea anemone belonging to the family Stichodactylidae. It is widespread throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-Pacific, from the eastern coasts of Africa and the Red Sea to Polynesia, and from south Japan to Australia and New Caledonia. It prefers hard-base substrates slightly covered with sand but it can also cling to branching corals from the surface to a depth of 40 metres (130 ft). This sebae anemone was photographed in Ras Muhammad National Park, Egypt. A tiny Red Sea clownfish can be seen among the anemone's tentacles in the centre of the image. ",
